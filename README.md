# Python_problems
Some Katas from codewars and other problems solved whilst learning Python

Just solving a bunch of stuff and playing with the Python language

I used to despise python but that's obviously because I had no skill.

Obviously, the truth is that I didn't like the feeling of 'not knowing' or being bad at something

I'm glad at got over that
